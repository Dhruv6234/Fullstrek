(1)  	What is JavaScript? 

    	==> JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used to create interactive front-end web applications, but it can also be used for server-side programming and desktop applications. It is a high-level, interpreted language and it is supported by all major web browsers. 

(2)	What is the use of isNaN function?

	==> The isNaN() function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number). It returns true if the value passed to it is NaN and false if the value passed to it is a number.


(3)	What is negative Infinity?

	==> In JavaScript, "negative infinity" is a special value that represents a number that is less than negative infinity. It is represented by the constant -Infinity. The concept of infinity is a mathematical concept, and it represents a value that is larger than any other value. Negative infinity is the opposite of positive infinity, and it represents a value that is smaller than any other value.


(4)	Which company developed JavaScript?

	==> JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, which was an American computer services company. JavaScript was first introduced in 1995 as a programming language for the Netscape Navigator web browser. The language was created by Brendan Eich, who was working at Netscape at the time. JavaScript was originally called Mocha, then changed to LiveScript, before finally being named JavaScript.


(5)	What are undeclared and undefined variables?

	==> Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but does not have a value. It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned with any value. Undefined is not a keyword.
	==> Undeclared variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all. It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using var or const keyword. If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with return value as “undefined”. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.


(6)	Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

	==> document.createElement("<tagName>");  
      		// Where <tagName> can be any HTML 
      		// tagName like div, ul, button, etc.

      	    	newDiv element has been created
      		For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");


(7)	What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

	==> The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.


(8)	What is === operator?

	==> In JavaScript, the === operator is a comparison operator that tests for strict equality between two values. It compares both the value and the type of the operands. The === operator returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type, otherwise it returns false. In general, it's recommended to use === operator for equality comparison because it ensures that the operands have the same type and value. 


(9)	How can the style/class of an element be changed? 

	==> Using the style property, Using the className property, Using the classList property.


(10)	How to read and write a file using JavaScript?

	==> readFile() and rs. writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript. The file is read using the fs. readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method.


(11)	What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

	==> JavaScript provides several ways to loop through code, including: 
		for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
		for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
		for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
		while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
		do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.


(12)	How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?

	==> In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed-in string parameter or value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of the base which is specified in the second argument of the parseInt() function.


(13)	What is the function of the delete operator?

	==> The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.


(14)	What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?

	==> In JavaScript, there are several types of pop-up boxes that can be used to interact with the user:

		1 alert()
		2 confirm()
		3 prompt()


(15)	What is the use of Void (0)?

	==>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.


(16)	How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?

	==>  We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.
         	Syntax:
        		<script>
        			window.location = <Path / URL>
        		</script>


(17)	What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?

	==> 	Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved.
		Replacement is done everywhere.
		It is not possible to append innerHTML.
		Breaks the document.
		Used for Cross-site Scripting.
